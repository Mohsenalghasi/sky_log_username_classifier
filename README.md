# sky_log_username_classifier

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to classify usernames from server log entries.  
The objective is to automatically route logs and reduce manual inspection time.

## 🧠 Approach
- Log parsing and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (structured features + TF-IDF)
- Baseline model: Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains anonymized log records.
(The raw dataset is excluded from the repository for confidentiality.)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Open the notebook:
   sky_log_username_classifier.ipynb
